## Development Process
### 1. Project Setup
- Analyzed the Figma design to determine structure and styling.
- Created a well-structured folder system to manage files efficiently.
- Set up SASS with a compiler (Live Sass Compiler in VS Code).

### 2. HTML Structure
- Used **semantic HTML** elements for better readability and SEO.
- Ensured clean, accessible, and well-indented code.

### 3. SASS Styling
- **Modular SASS Approach:**
  - Used partials for buttons, forms, navigation, typography, and layouts.
  - Maintained a structured and reusable CSS architecture.
- **SASS Features Implemented:**
  - Variables for colors, fonts, and spacing.
  - Nesting to keep styles organized.
  - Mixins for reusable styles.
  - Responsive design enhancements using media queries.

### 4. Version Control & Collaboration
- Managed the repository on **GitHub**, ensuring regular commits with descriptive messages.
- Used **branches and pull requests** for smooth collaboration (if applicable).

### 5. Testing & Refinement
- Ensured cross-browser compatibility (tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari).
- Conducted code reviews for consistency and best practices.
- Deployed using **Vercel**.

## Features
- **Fully responsive design** that adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Optimized performance** with modular CSS and efficient HTML structuring.
- **Accessible and user-friendly** interface for seamless navigation.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **SASS (SCSS)**
- **CSS3**
- **Git & GitHub**
- **Vercel** (for deployment)
